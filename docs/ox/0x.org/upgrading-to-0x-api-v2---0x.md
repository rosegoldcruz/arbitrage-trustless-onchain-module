# Upgrading to 0x API v2

## Upgrade Guides[‚Äã](#upgrade-guides "Direct link to Upgrade Guides")

Upgrade your project to take advantage of the latest v2 functionality:

[## üìÑÔ∏è To Swap API v2

Learn how to upgrade to the latest version (v2) of Swap API](/docs/upgrading/upgrading_to_swap_v2)

[## üìÑÔ∏è To Gasless API v2

Learn how to upgrade to the latest version (v2) of Gasless API](/docs/upgrading/upgrading_to_gasless_v2)

## Why migrate to v2?[‚Äã](#why-migrate-to-v2 "Direct link to Why migrate to v2?")

Upgrading to API v2 ensures your integration stays competitive and unlocks significant benefits:

1. **Access New Features**  
   API v2 introduces cutting-edge enhancements, including advanced quote validation, buy/sell tax support, Permit2 support, additional monetization controls, and more. With continuous reinvestment in v2, staying on v1 means missing out on new features and benefits.
2. **Achieve Better Pricing**  
   Get the most competitive prices using our next-generation pricing engine with multi-hop and multi-plex routing.
3. **Expand to New Chains**  
   Access 5+ additional chains and new liquidity sources, broadening your reach across the ecosystem.

## API v1 Lifecycle Stages[‚Äã](#api-v1-lifecycle-stages "Direct link to API v1 Lifecycle Stages")

This table outlines the key phases in the API v1 lifecycle, detailing the support levels, activities, and timelines for each stage. As API v1 transitions towards deprecation and eventual sunset, it is crucial for teams to plan their migration to API v2 to ensure uninterrupted access to the latest features, better pricing, and expanded chain support.

| Stage | Support Level | Activities | v1 Dates |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Active Development | Full support, including new feature development | Feature development, bug fixes, and updates | Q1 2024 |
| Maintenance Mode | Partial support; no new feature development | Critical bug fixes and security updates | Q1 2024 - Q3 2024 |
| Deprecated | Gradual phase-out with an end-of-support timeline; migration to v2 is recommended | No updates; minimal support; users are encouraged to migrate | Dec 13, 2024 - April 11, 2025 |
| Sunset - End of Life *(Current Stage)* | No support; API v1 will be turned off | API v1 fully retired; endpoints will no longer be accessible | April 11, 2025 |

## What's happening with v1?[‚Äã](#whats-happening-with-v1 "Direct link to What's happening with v1?")

**0x API v1** was sunset on **April 11, 2025**.

Following the sunset date, all teams must have upgraded to **v2** to continue using our endpoints. In the meantime, no updates will be made, nor will support be provided to API v1.

Please [migrate](https://0x.org/docs/upgrading) to **API v2** to keep your product running smoothly.

### What does ‚Äúsunset‚Äù mean?[‚Äã](#what-does-sunset-mean "Direct link to What does ‚Äúsunset‚Äù mean?")

API v1 was retired on **April 11, 2025**. Integrators will no longer be able to use v1 endpoints.

Sunsetting API v1 will enable us to focus on expanding and upgrading v2 üöÄ
